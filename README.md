# AdventOfCode_2019

Open repository for people to post their answers to.
Feel free to do it in any language you would like.
Follow what I did to set up your folder, just put your github account name and put all your answers there.

I would prefer if all inputs files were added to the .gitignore, though it isn't necessary.
